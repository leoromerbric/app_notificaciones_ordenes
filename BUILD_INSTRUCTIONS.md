# Build and run this Flutter app:

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure Flutter 3.24+ is installed

## Build Steps
1. Get dependencies: `flutter pub get`
2. Generate code files: `flutter packages pub run build_runner build`
3. Run the app: `flutter run`

## Fixes Applied
This project had missing dependencies that caused build failures:
- Added `flutter_localizations` and `intl` dependencies to pubspec.yaml
- Configured localization delegates in MaterialApp.router
- Android v2 embedding is properly configured

The error "Build failed due to use of deleted Android v1 embedding" and missing import errors for `flutter_localizations` and `intl` should now be resolved.
