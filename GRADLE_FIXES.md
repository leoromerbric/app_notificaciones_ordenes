# Android Build Configuration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Conflicting Build Files
- **Problem**: The project had both `build.gradle` and `build.gradle.kts` files in the `android/app/` directory, causing conflicts
- **Solution**: Removed the old `android/app/build.gradle` file and kept the newer Kotlin DSL version (`build.gradle.kts`)

### 2. Fixed Flutter Root Reference
- **Problem**: The old `build.gradle` file referenced `$flutterRoot` which was not properly defined, causing "Could not get unknown property 'flutterRoot'" error
- **Solution**: Updated the configuration to use proper Flutter Gradle Plugin integration

### 3. Removed Problematic Project Evaluation Dependencies
- **Problem**: The root `build.gradle.kts` had `project.evaluationDependsOn(":app")` which caused circular dependencies
- **Solution**: Removed this line as it's not needed with proper Flutter Gradle Plugin configuration

### 4. Enhanced Flutter SDK Path Resolution
- **Problem**: The settings.gradle.kts required an exact Flutter SDK path and would fail if not found
- **Solution**: Added fallback logic to handle missing Flutter SDK more gracefully:
  - Checks if local.properties exists before trying to read it
  - Validates that the Flutter tools directory exists before including it
  - Provides fallback to environment variable or default path

### 5. Updated Local Properties
- **Problem**: Local properties had Windows-specific paths that wouldn't work on other systems
- **Solution**: Updated to use more standard paths that can be adjusted per environment

### 6. Added Missing Gradle Wrapper Files
- **Problem**: The project was missing `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` wrapper scripts
- **Solution**: Created the standard Gradle wrapper files to enable building without requiring Gradle to be installed globally

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed**: `android/app/build.gradle` (conflicting old file)
2. **Updated**: `android/settings.gradle.kts` - Added robust Flutter SDK path resolution
3. **Updated**: `android/build.gradle.kts` - Removed problematic evaluation dependencies
4. **Updated**: `android/app/build.gradle.kts` - Uses proper Flutter Gradle Plugin integration
5. **Updated**: `android/local.properties` - Updated paths to be more environment-agnostic
6. **Added**: `android/gradlew` and `android/gradlew.bat` - Gradle wrapper scripts

## How This Fixes the Original Error

The original error had multiple causes:
1. **"Could not get unknown property 'flutterRoot'"** - Fixed by removing the old build.gradle file that had this improper reference
2. **"project ':app' does not specify compileSdk"** - Fixed by ensuring only the correct build.gradle.kts file is used, which properly defines compileSdk
3. **Build configuration conflicts** - Resolved by removing duplicate build files and fixing project evaluation dependencies

## Testing the Fix

To test that this resolves the issue:
1. Ensure Flutter SDK is properly installed and configured
2. Update `android/local.properties` with correct paths for your environment
3. Run `flutter run` or `flutter build` commands

The configuration now properly integrates with Flutter's build system and should resolve the "BUILD FAILED" errors mentioned in the original issue.
